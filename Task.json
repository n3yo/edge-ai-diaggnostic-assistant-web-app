Changes in the signals are indicative of protein expression changes as a cellular response to stress in the system [GeneSymbol:TP53 | GeneID:7157 | Uniprot_SwissProt_Accession:P04637]. The biological focus is gain/loss of cell death and the technological target is protein-specified.\nQuestion: Given a drug SMILES string, predict whether it\n(A) is not toxic in the described assay (B) is toxic in the described assay\nDrug SMILES: {Drug SMILES}\nAnswer:"
